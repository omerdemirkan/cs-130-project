# Fuseki Visualizer

This repo contains the project of Team B6 for UCLA COM SCI 130 for Winter '23. Its motivation can be summarized by Professor Elaasar's first project idea, the **Graph Database Visualizer**: 
Fuseki is a popular open-source graph database web server that supports representing information using the standard RDF format (triples: subject, predicate, object) and querying them using the standard SPARQL language. Fuseki allows uploading data, querying data, and inspecting the results as tables. In this project, we have created a better visualizer web app for the data in a Fuseki database.

Instructions for how to build and test locally can be found at the [wiki](https://github.com/omerdemirkan/cs-130-project/wiki). Deployment status can be checked using Vercel's integration in the [actions tab](https://github.com/omerdemirkan/cs-130-project/deployments).
